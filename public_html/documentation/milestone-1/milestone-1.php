		<p><strong>Name</strong>: Amy Koa</p>
		<p><strong>Age</strong>: 38</p>
		<p><strong>Profession</strong>: Amy Kao, the co-founder and CMO of RxAll looking to hire a full-time Web Developer.
			RxAll is a deep learning hyperspectral IoT platform for authenticating drugs.
			The platform uses a proprietary molecular sensor device with a cloud-based IP-protected deep
			learning algorithm and database of spectral signatures of drugs (both prescription and recreational)
			to carry out non-destructive drug authentication.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Technology</strong>:  Mac power user. Uses a Mac Pro Tower with 2 30‚Äù cinema displays while in the office, a MacBook
			Pro laptop at home, and an iPhone 11  with an unlimited 4G data connection.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>: Very busy entrepreneur having less than 5 minutes to spend viewing a
			portfolio website. Amy is a new social media user seeking potential candidates through tech and
			medecine community networking events, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs</strong>: RxAll is in need of better online presence and visibility.
			Amy needs to hire someone with competence and development experience who is willing
			to start at a competitive entry-level salary, to start. Amy is also looking for someone with a
			good personality and positive mindset. Because Amy is looking to hire within a very competitive
			market, she is flooded with candidates but is having a hard time finding someone with the
			right combination of talent, experience, and personality who is willing to accept a slightly lower
			salary and limited benefits. She must hire within 1 month.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Goals</strong>: Amy is mainly concerned with one thing; is this person a potential candidate for the RxAll
			Web Dev position? Can Amy, within 5 minutes max, determine whether this person is worthy of a preliminary
			phone screen regarding the job? Amy doesn't want to waste time. Amy needs to know via a very fast
			interaction with the site whether or not this potential candidate has the minimum qualifications to
			warrant a call.
		</p>
		<p><strong>User Story</strong>: As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a good candidate for the entry
		level Web Developer position.
